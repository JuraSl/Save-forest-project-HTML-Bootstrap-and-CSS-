                       <h3>Importance of Forest</h3><br><br>
                       <ul><p>Forests cover a third of all land on Earth, providing vital organic 
infrastructure for some of the planet's densest, most diverse collections of life. They support 
countless species as well as 1.6 billion human livelihoods, yet humans are also responsible for 
32 million acres of deforestation every year.</p><br>
                           <p><strong>1. They help us breathe.</strong></p>
                           <p>Forests pump out the oxygen we need to live and absorb the carbon 
dioxide we exhale (or emit). Just one adult leafy tree can produce as much oxygen in a season as 
10 people inhale in a year. Plankton are more prolific, providing half of Earth's oxygen, but forests 
are still a key source of breathable air.</p><br>
                           <p><strong>2. They're more than just trees.</strong></p>
                           <p>Nearly half of all known species live in forests, including 80 percent 
of biodiversity on land. That variety is especially rich in tropical rain forests, from rare parrots 
to endangered apes, but forests teem with life around the planet: Bugs and worms work nutrients into 
soil, bees and birds spread pollen and seeds, and keystone species like wolves and big cats keep hungry 
herbivores in check.</p><br>
                           <p><strong>3. People live there, too.</strong></p>
                           <p>Some 300 million people live in forests worldwide, including an estimated 
60 million indigenous people whose survival depends almost entirely on native woods. Many millions more 
live along or near forest fringes, but even just a scattering of urban trees can raise property values 
and lower crime.</p><br>
                           <p><strong>4. They keep us cool.</strong></p>
                           <p>By growing a canopy to hog sunlight, trees also create vital oases of shade 
on the ground. Urban trees help buildings stay cool, reducing the need for electric fans or air conditioners, 
while large forests can tackle daunting tasks like curbing a city's "heat island" effect or regulating 
regional temperatures.</p><br>
                           <p><strong>5. They keep Earth cool.</strong></p>
                           <p>Trees also have another way to beat the heat: absorb CO2 that fuels global 
warming. Plants always need some CO2 for photosynthesis, but Earth's air is now so thick with extra emissions 
that forests fight global warming just by breathing. CO2 is stored in wood, leaves and soil, often for 
centuries.</p><br>
                           <p><strong>6. They make it rain.</strong></p>
                           <p>Large forests can influence regional weather patterns and even create their 
own microclimates. The Amazon, for example, generates atmospheric conditions that not only promote regular 
rainfall there and in nearby farmland, but potentially as far away as the Great Plains of North America.</p><br>
                           <p><strong>7. They fight flooding.</strong></p>
                           <p>Tree roots are key allies in heavy rain, especially for low-lying areas 
like river plains. They help the ground absorb more of a flash flood, reducing soil loss and property 
damage by slowing the flow.</p><br>
                           <p><strong>8. They pay it forward.</strong></p>
                           <p>On top of flood control, soaking up surface runoff also protects ecosystems 
downstream. Modern stormwater increasingly carries toxic chemicals, from gasoline and lawn fertilizer to 
pesticides and pig manure, that accumulate through watersheds and eventually create low-oxygen "dead zones."</p><br>
                           <p><strong>9. They refill aquifers.</strong></p>
                           <p>Forests are like giant sponges, catching runoff rather than letting it roll 
across the surface, but they can't absorb all of it. Water that gets past their roots trickles down into 
aquifers, replenishing groundwater supplies that are important for drinking, sanitation and irrigation 
around the world.</p><br>
                           <p><strong>10. They block wind.</strong></p><br>
                           <p>Farming near a forest has lots of benefits, like bats and songbirds that 
eat insects or owls and foxes that eat rats. But groups of trees can also serve as a windbreak, providing 
a buffer for wind-sensitive crops. And beyond protecting those plants, less wind also makes it easier for 
bees to pollinate them.</p><br>
                           <p><strong>11. They keep dirt in its place.</strong></p>
                           <p>A forest's root network stabilizes huge amounts of soil, bracing the entire 
ecosystem's foundation against erosion by wind or water. Not only does deforestation disrupt all that, but 
the ensuing soil erosion can trigger new, life-threatening problems like landslides and dust storms.</p><br>
                           <p><strong>12. They clean up dirty soil.</strong></p>
                           <p>In addition to holding soil in place, forests may also use phytoremediation 
to clean out certain pollutants. Trees can either sequester the toxins away or degrade them to be less 
dangerous. This is a helpful skill, letting trees absorb sewage overflows, roadside spills or contaminated 
runoff.</p><br>
                           <p><strong>13. They clean up dirty air.</strong></p>
                           <p>We herald houseplants for purifying the air, but don't forget forests. They 
can clean up air pollution on a much larger scale, and not just the aforementioned CO2. Trees catch and soak 
in a wide range of airborne pollutants, including carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide.</p><br>
                           <p><strong>14. They muffle noise pollution.</strong></p>
                           <p>Sound fades in forests, making trees a popular natural noise barrier. The 
muffling effect is largely due to rustling leaves — plus other woodland white noise, like bird songs — 
and just a few well-placed trees can cut background sound by 5 to 10 decibels, or about 50 percent as 
heard by human ears.</p><br>
                           <p><strong>15. They feed us.</strong></p>
                           <p>Not only do trees provide fruits, nuts, seeds and sap, but they also enable a 
cornucopia near the forest floor, from edible mushrooms, berries and beetles to larger game like deer, turkeys, 
rabbits and fish.</p><br>
                           <p><strong>16. They give us medicine.</strong></p><br>
