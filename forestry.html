                       <h3>Forestry</h3><br><br>
                          <ul><p><strong>Forestry</strong> is the study of this complex interaction, the management 
of the various components of the forest, the preservation of its' natural balance (of forests and the life forms 
they support) as well as the care of it to ensure its' wellbeing.</p><br>
                              <p>Good forestry programs also make it possible for humans to get some economic value 
from it, without hurting the forests in anyway. This way of using the forest is known as Sustainable Forestry.</p><br>
                              <p><strong>Sustainable Forestry</strong></p>
                              <p>In sustainable forestry, efforts are put into replacing almost all the resources we 
get from the forests, whiles extra care is taken to ensure that there is very little damage to wildlife and the 
natural environment.</p><br>
                              <p><strong>Example:</strong> only old trees may be cut down, allowing younger trees to 
grow to ensure continuity, and trees are planted to replace the ones cut down.</p>
                         </ul> 
                         <div id="forestry">
                              <img src="http://eschooltoday.com/forests/images/sustainable-forests.jpg">
                         </div>
                         <ul><br>
                             <p>Unfortunately, environmental issues cannot be separated from politics and economics 
(people’s life) This is why effective sustainable forestry comes in two approaches. These are:</p><br>
                                <li><p><strong>Forests and Forests related Industries</strong><br>
Here, the attention is on the natural resource itself and the timber companies that harness resources directly from 
the forests. In this approach, there are usually very strict rules and consequences with the way resources are 
extracted from that forest. It is usually enforced by laws, hefty fines and effective monitoring efforts. In recent 
time, the use of technology is helping authorities see more about what is goin on in the forests.</p>
                                    <p>This means items made from resources that come from forests will cost a lot in 
the shops, so consumers also need to be prepared.</p><br>
                                <li><p><strong>Consumer behavior</strong><br>
Here, campaigns are developed to educate consumers (industries and individuals including you) on the value of forests 
resources and the dangers forests face. Efforts are directed to make people become more environmentally friendly. 
Example, people are encouraged to recycle more, to use paper products from recycled pulp, and to encourage everyone 
to join the fight to save our forests.</p><br>
