                       <h3>How can we help</h3><br><br>
                       <ul><p>Sometimes, we are overwhelmed by the extent of damage humans have caused, 
and we are not sure if an individual can make any impact. Yes you can, there are millions of people just 
like you, who are learning about the issue and taking little steps to help. Additionally, many governments, 
organizations and societies are making great strides in helping reducing deforestation, and encouraging 
forest plantations. But there is still a lot to do.</p><br>
                          <p>Due to the extent and nature of forest destruction, efforts to stop deforestation 
and preserve them are best achieved at government and organization levels. This means that laws, rules and 
regulations from countries can help to enforce the preservation of forests. Laws on farming, timber and wood, 
as well as land use must be encouraged and enforced.</p><br>
                          <p><strong>Here are a few things you can also do to help.</strong></p>
                             <li>Make a conscious effort to share information with others (friends at school and 
family members) on deforestation and its' effects. Some of your friends may laugh at you and say it is silly 
to think that you can solve problems like this. But that is OK, things work better when responsible people 
don’t give up. Stand up for what you believe in.<br>
                             <li>Join organizations, forest-preservation societies and pressure groups that 
aim to help preserve the rest of our natural resources. When more people work together, the impact is greater.<br>
                             <li>Reduce the use of artificial items, recycle more and re-use items. Wood, paper, 
plastics and many other things we use everyday at home can be linked to natural resources being destroyed. 
This means that if we all recycle more, there will be less dependence on the environment (and trees). 
It also means that companies and governments will import less raw-materials from the forest regions of the world.<p><br>
                          <p>There is a fun way to remember the most important points in forest preservation called TREES which means...</p>
                             <li><strong>Teach</strong> others about the importance of the environment and how they can help save rainforests.<br>
                             <li><strong>Restore</strong> damaged ecosystems by planting trees on land where forests have been cut down.<br>
                             <li><strong>Encourage</strong> people to live in a way that doesn't hurt the environment.<br>
                             <li><strong>Establish</strong> parks to protect rainforests and wildlife.<br>
                             <li><strong>Support</strong> companies that operate in ways that minimize damage to the environment.</p><br>
