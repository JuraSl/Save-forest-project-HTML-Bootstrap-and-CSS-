                       <h3>Deforestation</h3><br><br>
                       <ul><p>Since the industrial age, about half of world's original forests have been destroyed and millions of animals and living 
things have been endangered. Despite the improvements in education, information and general awareness of the importance of forests, deforestation has 
not reduced much, and there are still many more communities and individuals who still destroy forest lands for personal gains.</p><br>
                           <p>Economic development both causes deforestation and slows it. In the early stages of development people destroy forests 
for a meagre living. Globalisation is speeding up the process by boosting the demand for agricultural goods produced in tropical countries. At the same 
time, as people in emerging countries become more prosperous, they start thinking about issues beyond their family's welfare; their governments begin 
to pass and slowly enforce laws to conserve the environment. Trade can also allow the greener concerns of rich-world consumers to influence 
developing-world producers.</p><br>
                           <p>The transition from clearing to protecting, however, is occurring too slowly. The main international effort to speed it 
up is an idea known as REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation), which pays people in developing countries to leave trees 
standing. This is not an outlandish concept. It is increasingly common for governments and companies to pay for forest and other ecosystem services. 
To protect its watershed, New York pays farmers in the Catskills not to develop their land. REDD schemes aspire to do this on a much larger scale. 
The only notable success of the Copenhagen climate-change conference last year was a commitment to pursue them. Half a dozen rich countries, including 
Norway, America and Britain, have promised $4.5 billion for starters.</p><br>
                            <p>The difficulties are immense. REDD projects will be effective only in places where the government sort-of works, and the 
tropical countries with the most important forests include some of the world's worst-run places. Even in countries with functioning states, some of the 
money is bound to be stolen. Yet with sufficient attention to monitoring, verification and, crucially, making sure the cash goes to the people who can 
actually protect the forest, REDD could work. That will cost much more than has so far been pledged. The most obvious source of extra cash is the carbon 
market, or preferably a carbon tax. Since saving forests is often the cheapest way to tackle carbon emissions, funding it this way makes sense.</p><br>
                            <p>With global climate-change negotiations foundering, the prospects of raising cash for REDD that way look poor. But the 
money must be found from somewhere. Without a serious effort to solve this problem, the risk from climate change will be vastly increased and the planet 
will lose one of its most valuable, and most beautiful, assets. That would be a tragedy.</p><br><br>
